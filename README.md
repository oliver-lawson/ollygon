# ollygon

#### 3d editor and renderer built in C++/OpenGL


### Current status:
- It can't do anything. displays a sphere and just about runs.

### Goals:
Personal project with the aim of learning more about:
- C++ application building with Qt
- Geometry
- Light Transport (eventually):  I'd like to use this as a vehicle to work through my copy of PBRT vol4, having only got as far as Peter Shirley's excellent but short RT introduction books before.

### Building:
Requires:
- CMake 3.16
- Qt 6.9.1
- C++ 20 compiler

#### Windows (VS2022)
run the build .bat scripts
#### Linux
I haven't tested on Linux yet.  It presumably should work fine if cmake is called with gcc instead of msvc, then `make -j8`
